# Task Item Card

These is the card which you see inside the column under any specific board.

## Header

## Task Title

## Sub Tasks

## Task Description

By default the Task Description content will be hidden. You will see a light colored text `Show Description`. This is actually a clickable text, and once you click on this text, the Description Section will expand.

The Description content is kept hidden by default is because, there can be a lot of content inside the description for the task, and keeping in visible will consume a lot of board area, which will defeat the methodology of a Kanban Board. Whenever you want to take a look at the content of the Description of any specific task, you can expand it and read the content or make use of the links from the content.

Another thing is, the content will be compressed, that, is the indentaion of the content lines will be removed to save space. The idea here is to just show the content and not to worry about the formatting much, although all the other formatting will be applied like bold, italic, etc. The indentation is removed to again, show all the content in as much less area as posssible. You can look at the actual content by opening the [Edit Task Window](./EditTaskWindow.md) or by directly opening the markdown file.
